# spiffxp

Hi, I’m Aaron Crickenberger (aka Aaron of SIG Beard).  I work on [Kubernetes], and am mainly interested in things that improve contributors’ lives.  My current employer is [Google]

My Myers-Briggs is [INFP] last time I checked, so I empathize a lot and like 1:1 conversation, but dealing with people for too long will wear me out.  I bias toward action, preferring to solve today’s instance of the problem before solving tomorrow’s class of the problem.  That said, for those larger problems, I aim for public, documented decisions, driven and validated by data rather than gut feel.

## Contact

I am primarily available as @spiffxp on [kubernetes.slack.com]. It is the only thing that notifies me, and I mute notifications off-hours. I am usually in the Pacific timezone.  Refer to [Current Status](#current-status) for who to contact if I'm not available.

Everything else is best-effort, poll-only, including:
- (Google-only) Aaron Crickenberger on chat.google.com
- spiffxp@google.com
- spiffxp@gmail.com
- [@spiffxp on twitter](https://twitter.com/spiffxp)
- [@spiffxp on github](https://github.com/spiffxp) (notifications are useless)

I take _forever_ to write things.  I’m far more comfortable chatting things over, either in slack, or via whatever video-conference works for you (I like Zoom, Slack, and Google Hangouts)

## Current Status

I’m leading the [Kubernetes v1.14 Release][k8s114-readme].  My goal is to improve kubernetes quality through test health and explicit criteria for alpha/beta/stable. This will occupy the bulk of my time for Q1 2019. If I'm unavailable, please contact the [Release Lead Shadows][k8s114-team]

I’m an active participant in the [Conformance Defintion subproject of SIG Architecture][conformance-definition].  My focus is improving Kubernetes conformance test coverage, via coordination with the maintainers of [cncf/apisnoop] to measure/visualize it, and contractors to write additional conformance tests. If I'm unavailable, please contact the [cncf-k8s-conformance mailing list][cncf-k8s-conformance@]

I’m on my second term as a [Kubernetes Steering Committee][kubernetes/steering] member, and am trying to set priorities for the year. If I'm unavailable, please contact another member.

## My Average Week

I actively participate in the following Kubernetes-related groups:
- [cncf-k8s-conformance]
- [kubernetes-community]
- [kubernetes-sig-architecture]
- [kubernetes-sig-contributor-experience] (subproject owner)
- [kubernetes-sig-release]
- [kubernetes-sig-testing] (chair)
- [kubernetes/steering]

This means I show up to their weekly meetings, I’m in their slack channels, I read their mailing lists (though am generally quiet), I create/triage issues, and I author/review PR’s.

## Speaking Experience

TODO.  I made a [YouTube playlist][spiffxp-kubecon-2018-playlist].  I usually recycle my [steering committee election bio](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/events/elections/2018/aaroncrickenberger.md) for a speaker bio
