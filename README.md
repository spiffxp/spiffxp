# spiffxp

Hi, I'm Aaron Crickenberger (aka Aaron of SIG Beard).  I work on [Kubernetes],
and am mainly interested in things that improve contributors' lives. My
current employer is [Google]

My Myers-Briggs is [INFP] last time I checked. I empathize a lot and prefer
1:1 conversation. Peopling for too long will wear me out.  I bias toward
action, preferring to solve today's instance of the problem before solving
tomorrow's class of the problem.  For larger problems I value public,
documented decisions, driven and validated by data rather than gut feel.

Favorite foods: popcorn feeds my soul. I have been told this isn't a meal, and
refuse to believe it. Burgers and sushi are also acceptable.

## Contact

The best way to reach me is @spiffxp on [kubernetes.slack.com]. It is the only
thing that notifies me, though I mute all notifcations off-hours (I'm usuallly
in the Pacific timezone). See [Current Status](#current-status) for who to
contact if I'm not available

Everything else is best-effort, poll-only, including:
- (Google-only) spiffxp@ on chat.google.com
- spiffxp@google.com
- spiffxp@gmail.com
- [@spiffxp on twitter](https://twitter.com/spiffxp)
- [@spiffxp on github](https://github.com/spiffxp) (notifications are useless)

I take _forever_ to write things.  I'm far more comfortable talking things over,
either in slack, or via whatever video-conference works for you (I like Zoom,
Slack, and Google Hangouts)

## Current Status

I am an Organizer for [K8s Infra Working Group][kubernetes-wg-k8s-infra]. We
are setting up the public, community-owned home for all Kubernetes project
infrastructure. If I'm unavailable, please contact [@dims]

I am an active participant in the [Kubernetes Conformance subproject][conformance-definition].
I am focused on improving conformance test coverage. I'm doing this via test
authorship, PR review, tooling to lint conformance tests, and tooling to
measure coverage.  I coordinate with members of the [cncf/apisnoop] team.
If I'm unavailable, please contact [@timothysc]

I'm a subproject owner for the [Kubernetes GitHub Admin Team][github-management].
I am focused on ensuring the team is operating in a sustainable manner.

I'm on my second term as a [Kubernetes Steering Committee][kubernetes/steering]
member. I am focused on empowering the community and reducing areas where the
committee is a bottleneck. If I'm unavailable please contact another member

## My Average Week

I actively participate in the following Kubernetes-related groups:

- [kubernetes-community]
- [kubernetes-sig-architecture]
- [kubernetes-sig-contributor-experience] (as subproject owner: devstats, github-management)
- [kubernetes-sig-release] (as subproject owner: release-team)
- [kubernetes-sig-testing] (as chair)
- [kubernetes-wg-k8s-infra] (as organizer)
- [kubernetes/steering] (as member)

This means I show up to their weekly meetings, I'm in their slack channels,
I read their mailing lists (though am generally quiet), I create/triage
issues, and I author/review PR's.

I use the [Gubernator PR Dashboard][pr-dashboard] to keep track of PRs that
need my review. They pile up pretty quickly and my time is limited, so I am
unable to get to all of them nor am I able to respond as quickly as I would
like. I aim for a weekly thorough sweep.

## Speaking Experience

I have a [YouTube playlist][spiffxp-kubecon-playlist] of my talks.  I usually
recycle my [steering committee election bio][steering-bio] for a speaker bio
